###Monday 8/29 - Hello world
1. __Intro__ Meet and greet, workshop overview, objectives.
2. __Drawing Instructions__ An exercise inspired by the [Conditional Design group](http://conditionaldesign.org/). Read their [manifesto](http://conditionaldesign.org/manifesto/) and check out the [archive](http://conditionaldesign.org/archive/) of instructions and drawings. Check out [knots](http://conditionaldesign.org/workshops/knots/), [hatching](http://conditionaldesign.org/workshops/hatching/), and [convex city plan](http://conditionaldesign.org/workshops/convex-city-plan/).

  * Break into partners. As a team, devise a set of instructions to create a drawing. Write out the instructions on paper provided.
  * Switch instructions with another pair. You create a drawing based on their instructions, and they create a drawing based on yours.
  
3. __Discussion: context__
  * What is programming?
  * What is Processsing and p5.js?
  * What is happening with the browser?
  * What can you make? Some [incomplete ispiration](https://github.com/lmccart/p5-workshop/raw/master/inspiration.md).

4. __Playing around__

  * Create a Code Pen account: CodePen.com.  All of our club work will be collected here: http://codepen.io/collection/XwWjqZ/
  * Try adding some of the lines of code from [this list](https://github.com/lmccart/p5-workshop/blob/master/commands.md) into the places where it says `setup()` and `draw()`. Press the play button to run your code.
  * Can you figure out what each of the lines does? What is the difference between `setup()` and `draw()`?

5. __Tutorial: Basic drawing__ Download examples [here](https://github.com/lmccart/p5-workshop/raw/master/01_drawing/01_drawing.zip). More walk through examples [here](http://p5js.org/home/).

6. __Tutorial: Variables__ Download examples [here](https://github.com/lmccart/p5-workshop/raw/master/02_variables_animation/02_variables_animation.zip).
